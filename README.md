### Requirements

- Docker 
- Jellyfin API key - [How to generate an API key](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-generate-a-jellyfin-api-key)
- A TMDB API key (free) - [How to generate a TMDB API key](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-generate-a-tmdb-api-key)
- A SMTP server 

### Configuration with built-in cron job
This is the default and recommended way to run the newsletter. The Docker container will run on a schedule using a built-in cron job. It will run on the schedule defined in the `config/config.yml` file.

1. Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml) file:
```bash 
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
```

2. (optional) Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to change the default user or timezone.

3. Create a `config` folder in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```bash
mkdir config
```

4. Download the [config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml) in the `config` folder:
```
curl -o config/config.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml
```

5. Edit the `config/config.yml` file and fill in the required fields. **All non-commented fields are required.**

6. Run the docker container with docker compose 
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!note]
> Note: It is recommended to use a static version instead of `latest`, and manually upgrade. [Last version](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/releases)


### Configuration with external cron job
Use this method if you want to run the script on a schedule using an external cron job or task scheduler, instead of the built-in cron job. Docker will run once, and exit after sending the newsletter.

1. Create a `config` folder.
```bash
mkdir config
```

2. Download the [config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml) in the `config` folder:
```
curl -o config/config.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml
```

2. Edit the `config/config.yml` file and fill in the required fields. **All non-commented fields are required.**


3. Run the docker container to send the newsletter
```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v ./config:/app/config \
    ghcr.io/seaweedbraincy/jellyfin-newsletter:v0.8.0
```
> [!note]
> Note: It is recommended to use a static version instead of `latest`, and manually upgrade. [Last version](https://github.com/SeaweedbrainCY/jellyfin-newsletter/releases)

4. Schedule the script to run on a regular basis. 
```bash
# Unix :
crontab -e
# Add the following line to run the script every 1st of the month at 8am
0 8 1 * * root docker run --rm -v PATH_TO_CONFIG_FOLDER/config:/app/config/ ghcr.io/seaweedbraincy/jellyfin-newsletter:v0.8.0
```
